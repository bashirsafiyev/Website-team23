            <h1>Hour Of Code </h1>
            <p>Code.org originally introduced Hour of Code from December 9 to December 15, 2013, during Computer Science
                Education Week. The goal of the Hour of Code is to get people interested in coding and familiar with it.
                In order to accomplish this, hour-long, ostensibly interesting, and instructional activities are hosted.
                Hour of Code aims to create computer science classes, motivate students, and educate teachers to teach
                computer science, among other things. A number of educational online learning portals also supported it.
                Over 600 million lines of code were written by roughly 20 million participants. Typically, Hour of Code
                begins on the second Tuesday in December and ends on the third Tuesday of the same month. </p>

            <h1>The Event of Hour Of Code</h1>
            <p>
                On November 14, at 10:00, we had a meeting in the 10b class of secondary school lyceum No. 299, Baku.
                The main purpose of our meeting was to give a little information about ADA University and to implement
                #HourofCode event related to computer science week. We've tried to teach kids the basics of coding in a
                fun way through little games on Code.org. We were very pleased that the students listened to us with
                interest and passion for this field. In the end, we left with good impressions of the children.
